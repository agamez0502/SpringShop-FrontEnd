# 🛒 SpringShop Frontend

This is the front-end interface for **SpringShop**, an e-commerce web app powered by a Spring Boot API. The UI allows customers to browse products, manage their cart, register/login, and update their profile — all backed by a secure RESTful backend.

> 💻 Built with the starter code provided by my program, with minor UI enhancements including updated background styling and layout polish.
